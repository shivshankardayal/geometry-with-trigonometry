\chapterdef{geometry}

\color{black}Geometry is one of the oldest branches of math along with arithmetic, and one of the most
fundamental. The {\it Elements} by Euclid, a Greek matheatician c. $300$ BC, which is a series of $13$
books, is one of the first profound works on Geometry. Most of what we will study about geometry in this
book is based on the book from Euclid. Some scholars believe that the {\it Elements} is
largely a compilation of work of earlier Greek mathematicians. Geometry comes from an ancient Greek word
meaning `land measurement'. What we will study in this book lays the fundamental principles of basic
geometry, which will be useful to you when you study more advanced branches of mathematics.

\section{Points and Lines}

A {\it point} is a dimensionless figure. This means that it has no length, width and depth. Essentially, a
point is invisible. However, we usually denote it with a .(dot). If we join two points such that resulting
figure has only one dimension of length then the resulting figure would be a {\it line}.

\indent The \ref{sl} shown is a figure of a straight line. A line in general is also called a straight line,
which is the shortest distance between the two points.

On any straight line there are infinite points. Usually, it is called a {\it line segement}, while a line
stretches from $+\infty$ to $-\infty$. What we see in the figure is a line segment. Usually a line is drawn
with arrows at both ends, which denote that the line stretches to infinity.
