## This book is written as a way to give back to the world for what I have received.

You need `TeX` with `eplain` installed for this.

To make used of
`make` you will need the GNU Make installed. The reason for not giving PDF is that it is
a binary file, and makes the `.git` file bloat.

`Emacs` was used to write this books using `Auctex` with `ConTeXt`-mode.

## Download Link

A download link will be provided once it is reasonably complete.

Note that this build will almost always lag the sources till we reach a stable release.

## LICENSE
All the files in this repository are licensed under GNU FDL 1.3 or later. The `TeX` sources are
present in the root folder. In the built PDF it is appended at the end.
